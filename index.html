      <h3>About me.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have always been obsessed with science and technology, and I always
        had these two questions in my mind how and why for everything, when I
        was a kid my mother bought me a watch on my birthday as I loved them
        back then, However I asked how it works and how the watch know what time
        it is, so I opened it up to see what is inside after that I wanted to
        open up everything in the house including our TV and I always would wish
        for the TV to break so I can open it and see whatâ€™s inside. I always
        wished to make a car that could talk and drive by itself after watching
        a movie in 2008 in which a car drove itself then in 2012, I saw a
        documentary about google making autonomous driving car, I was so amazed
        with it that it became dream of mine to become an automotive engineer,
        however when I learned what programming was and what could I achieve
        with it, I immediately enrolled to computing course at that time I did
        not have much knowledge about the topic I just knew that I could build
        software with them I decided to become a software engineer, my first
        year I was very excited about it to learn programming, however second
        year I got a bit disappointed as they kept repeating the same topic
        again and again so we ended up learning just the basics in two years
        diploma, now I want to gain more in dept about the topic and hopefully
        will gain and learn more skills during this course, so that I will be
        able to build all my ideas into reality.
